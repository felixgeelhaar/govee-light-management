### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/govee-light-management.git
   cd govee-light-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Stream Deck CLI globally**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @elgato/cli
   ```

4. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

5. **Install the plugin for testing**
   ```bash
   streamdeck install com.felixgeelhaar.govee-light-management.sdPlugin
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm test                    # Run unit tests
   npm run test:coverage       # Check test coverage
   npm run lint               # Check code style
   npm run type-check         # TypeScript type checking
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

   We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` New features
   - `fix:` Bug fixes
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `style:` Code style changes
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `test:` Test additions or modifications
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use async/await over Promises where possible

### Architecture

We follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/          # Stream Deck action handlers (Application Layer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/           # Business logic (Domain Layer)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/     # Business entities
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/ # Repository interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/     # Domain services
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/   # External integrations (Infrastructure Layer)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/ # Repository implementations
```

### Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types, use proper TypeScript types
- **Testing**: Write tests for all business logic and public APIs

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

### E2E Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e        # Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Run E2E tests with UI
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies (Govee API, Stream Deck SDK)

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods and classes
- Include parameter types and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Document any assumptions or limitations

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Update troubleshooting section for known issues
- Include migration guides for breaking changes
